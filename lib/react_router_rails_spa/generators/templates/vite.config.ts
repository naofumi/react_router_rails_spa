    // However, when using the vite development server, assets will be served from port 5173,
    // and the API server will be on port 3000 (Rails default).
    // The use of different ports complicates CORS settings and cookie handling.
    //
    // To work around this, Vite provides a proxy mode that can receive API requests
    // on port (5173) and forward them to the Rails server (port 3000).
    // From the browser's viewpoint, all communications including API requests to the Rails server
    // will now happen on port 5173, so CORS will no longer be necessary.

        // Instead, a request for Posts is handled by "http://localhost:3000/posts".
        // Therefore, we strip the "/api" prefix from the request path before
        // sending it to Rails.
        //
        // Note that if the Rails server has a dedicated namespace for APIs,
        // then you can just use that instead of "/api", and the following
        // rewrite rule will not be necessary.
        //
        // Also see `frontend/app/utilities/proxy.ts` for how we handle this inside React.
